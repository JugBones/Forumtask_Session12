70. FOREWORD
71. 
72. 
73. Dear Little Comrades:
74. 
75. The work of translating this little book of fairy tales for workers’
76. children is very small in comparison to the joy I get from the
77. knowledge that you, my beloved young comrades, are going to enjoy it.
78. 
79. You have read many fairy tales, some of them very beautiful and some
80. that frightened you with their horrible giants and goblins. But never,
81. I am sure, have you read such lovely stories about real everyday
82. things. You see poor people suffering around you every day; some of you
83. have yourselves felt how hard it is to be poor. You know that there are
84. rich people in the world, that they do not work and have all the good
85. things of life. You also know that your fathers work hard and then
86. worry about what will happen if they lose their jobs.
87. 
88. Comrade zur Mühlen, who wrote these fairy tales, tells us in a
89. beautiful way how these things can be stopped. All of us who work must
90. learn that we can make the world a better place for workers and their
91. children to live in if we will help one another. She shows us that the
92. rich people who do not work but keep us enslaved are our enemies; we
93. must join together, we workers of the world, and stop these wrongs.
94. 
95. Even the pretty, delicate Rose-bush knew how to use her thorns when the
96. rich lady came near her. The little Sparrow died while seeking a better
97. land for the Sparrow brothers, but he did not die in vain. The faithful
98. little grey dog gave his life for the Negro boy who had saved him from
99. being drowned; and the Crocodile proved that even an ugly, hungry beast
100. can be more kind than a rich slave-owner. And our little lonely friend
101. Paul learned that he must not stop asking why things were wrong in the
102. world, but that he must make comrades of all the workers and teach them
103. also to ask why, until millions would be asking that question and
104. seeking to find the answer to it.
105. 
106. When you read these stories, I am sure you will want to lend the book
107. to all your friends, so that they too may spend some happy hours with
108. the new friends you have found in the book.
109. 
110. 
111. Your loving comrade,
112. 
113. Ida Dailes.

122. THE ROSE-BUSH
123. 
124. 
125. The Rose-bush did not know where she was born and where she spent her
126. early days—it is a well known fact that flowers have a bad memory, but
127. to make up for that they can see into the future. When she first became
128. conscious of herself, she stood in the middle of a magnificent green
129. lawn. To one side of her she saw a great white stone house, that
130. gleamed through the branches of linden trees, to the other side stood a
131. high trellised gate through which she could see the street.
132. 
133. A thin tall man carefully tended the Rose-bush; he brought manure,
134. bound the drooping twigs of the Rose-bush together with bark, brought
135. water for the thirsty roots of the Rose-bush to drink. The Rose-bush
136. was grateful to the man, and as the buds she was covered with opened
137. into dainty red roses, she said to her friend, “You have taken care of
138. me, it is because of you that I have become so beautiful. Take some of
139. my loveliest blossoms in return.”
140. 
141. The man shook his head. “You mean well, dear Rose-bush, and I would
142. gladly take some of your beautiful blossoms for my sick wife. But I
143. dare not do it. You don’t belong to me.”
144. 
145. “I don’t belong to you!” exclaimed the Rose-bush. “Don’t I belong to
146. the person who has taken care of me and troubled himself about me? Then
147. to whom do I belong?”
148. 
149. The man pointed with his hand to the gleaming white house among the
150. trees and replied, “To the gracious lady who lives there.”
151. 
152. “That can’t be,” replied the Rose-bush. “I have never seen this lady.
153. It is not she who has sprinkled water on me, loosened the earth at my
154. roots, bound together my twigs. Then how can I belong to her?”
155. 
156. “She has bought you.”
157. 
158. “That is something different. Then the poor woman must have worked hard
159. to save so much money. Good! Half of my blossoms shall belong to her.”
160. 
161. The man laughed a little sadly, saying, “Oh, beloved Rose-bush, you
162. don’t yet know the world, I can see that. The lady did not lift a
163. finger to earn the money.”
164. 
165. “Then how did she get it?”
166. 
167. “She owns a great factory in which countless workers drudge; from there
168. comes her wealth.”
169. 
170. The Rose-bush became angry, lifted a bough up high, threatened the man
171. with her thorn-claws, shouting, “I see you enjoy yourself at my expense
172. because I am still young and inexperienced, telling me untruths about
173. the world of men. Still I am not so stupid, I have observed ants and
174. bees, and know that to each belongs the things for which he has
175. worked.”
176. 
177. “That may be so among bees and ants,” the man sighed deeply, “yet among
178. men it is different. There the people receive just enough to keep them
179. from starving—all else belongs to the master. The master builds
180. splendid mansions, plants lovely gardens, buys flowers.”
181. 
182. “Is that really true?”
183. 
184. “Yes.”
185. 
186. The man went back to his work and the Rose-bush began to meditate. Yet
187. the longer she thought, the worse her temper grew. Yes, even though she
188. usually had very fine manners, she spoke roughly to a bee who wished to
189. visit her. The bee was still young and timid, and flew off in fright as
190. fast as his wings could carry him. Then the Rose-bush was sorry for her
191. rough behavior, because she was naturally friendly, and also because
192. she might have asked the bee whether the man had spoken the truth.
193. 
194. While she was so engrossed in thought, suddenly some one shook her and
195. a mischievous voice asked, “Well, my friend, what are you dreaming
196. about?”
197. 
198. The Rose-bush looked up with her countless eyes and recognized the
199. Wind, that stood laughing before her shaking his head so that his long
200. hair flew about.
201. 
202. “Wind, beloved Wind!” joyfully exclaimed the Rose-bush, “You come as
203. though you had been called. Tell me whether the man has spoken the
204. truth.” And she reported everything the man had said to her.
205. 
206. The Wind suddenly became serious and whistled through his teeth so
207. violently that the branches of the Rose-bush began to tremble. “Yes,”
208. declared he, “all this is true, and even worse. I come here from all
209. over the whole world and see everything. Often I am so seized with
210. anger that I begin to rave; then the stupid people say, ‘My! what a
211. storm!’”
212. 
213. “And the rich people can really buy everything?”
214. 
215. “Yes,” growled the wind. Then suddenly he laughed. “Not me. They can’t
216. capture and imprison me. I am the friend of the poor. I fly to all
217. lands. In big cities, I station myself before ill-smelling cellars and
218. roar into them ‘Freedom! Justice!’ To tired, overworked people I sing a
219. lullaby, ‘Be courageous, keep together, fight, you will conquer!’ Then
220. they feel new strength, they know a comrade has spoken to them.” He
221. tittered, and all the leaves in the garden stirred. “The rich would
222. like to imprison me, because I carry the message, but I whistle at
223. them. At night I rattle their windows so that they become frightened in
224. their soft beds, and then I cry, ‘Ho ho, you idlers, your time is
225. coming. Make room for the workers of the world!’ At that they are very
226. frightened, draw the silken covers over their ears, try to comfort
227. themselves: ‘It was only the wind!’”
228. 
229. The Wind lifted one of his legs high and pushed it with all his weight
230. against the magnificent white house. The windows clattered, many things
231. in the house were broken, a woman’s voice shrieked. The Wind laughed,
232. then drew his leg back and said to the Rose-bush: “You also can do
233. something, you flowers. Do not bloom for the rich idlers, and the fruit
234. trees should not bear fruit. But you are pleasure-loving and lazy
235. creatures. Look at the Tulips that stand up so sturdily all day, always
236. saying nothing but ‘How lovely we are!’ They have no other interests.”
237. 
238. The petals of the Rose-bush became a deeper red, so ashamed was she of
239. her sister-flower.
240. 
241. The Wind noticed this and tried to comfort her. “You appear to be a
242. sensible, kind-hearted bush. I shall visit you more often. Give me one
243. of your petals as a parting gift.” He took a deep red petal from a full
244. blown rose. “Be happy—now I must leave.”
245. 
246. At that moment two poorly-dressed pale children came along the street.
247. They stopped before the gate and cried as though with one voice, “Oh,
248. the beautiful roses!” The little girl stretched her hands longingly
249. toward the blossoms.
250. 
251. “Wind, beloved Wind,” called the Rose-bush, as loud as she could.
252. “Before you fly away, break off two of my loveliest roses and throw
253. them to the children. But be careful that the petals do not drop off.”
254. 
255. “Do you think I am so clumsy?” grumbled the insulted Wind, breaking off
256. two handsome roses, and blew them lightly, gently to the children.
257. 
258. The children shouted joyfully, the Wind flew away, and the Rose-bush
259. enjoyed the happiness of the children. Her enjoyment did not last long.
260. An angry voice scolded the children. “What impudence is this, to steal
261. the flowers out of my garden!”
262. 
263. The Rose-bush saw a silk-clad lady with fingers that were covered with
264. rings threatening the children. Her smooth face was red with anger. The
265. children were frightened and ran off crying.
266. 
267. The Rose-bush breathed deep with indignation and her breath blew
268. sweeter perfume towards the lady’s face. She stepped closer. “Ah, the
269. beautiful roses. I had better pick them, otherwise the rabble from the
270. streets will steal them. And they are such an expensive kind.”
271. 
272. At this the Rose-bush became enraged, so that her blossoms blazed a
273. fiery red. “If I were only strong as the wind,” thought she, “I would
274. get hold of this evil woman and shake her so that she would become deaf
275. and blind. Such a common creature has a whole garden full of the most
276. gorgeous flowers and begrudges the children for two paltry roses. But
277. you shall not have even one of my blossoms, you bad woman, just wait.”
278. 
279. And as the woman bent down to pick the flowers, the Rose-bush hit her
280. in the face with a twig, stretching out all her thorns like a cat
281. stretches out its claws, and scratched up the woman’s face.
282. 
283. She screamed aloud. The woman did not want to cease from her task, but
284. the Rose-bush was as willful as she; wherever the hand of the woman
285. reached, a large thorn sprang out and scratched her till she bled.
286. 
287. At last the woman, with torn clothes, with scratched, dirty hands, had
288. to turn back home.
289. 
290. The Rose-bush was completely tired from the heated struggle. Her many
291. green arms hung limply, her flowers were paler, she sighed softly. Yet
292. she thought more deeply and arrived at a mighty resolution.
293. 
294. Late in the evening the Wind came flying to bid the Rose-bush
295. good-night, and the Rose-bush said to him solemnly, “Listen to me,
296. Brother Wind, I will follow your advice, I will no longer bloom for the
297. idlers.”
298. 
299. The Wind caressed the leaves and flowers of the Rose-bush with gentle
300. hands, saying earnestly, “Poor little Rose-bush, will you have the
301. strength for that? You will have to suffer a great deal.”
302. 
303. “Yes,” replied the Rose-bush, “I know it. But I will have the strength.
304. Only you must come every day and sing your song of freedom, so as
305. always to renew my courage.”
306. 
307. The Wind promised to do this.
308. 
309. Then followed bad days for the Rose-bush, for she had decided not to
310. drink any water, that she might cease blooming. When her friend came
311. with the water pot she drew her little roots close to herself, that no
312. drops might touch them. Ah, how she suffered! she thought she would
313. faint. In the day-time the sun shone, and she became more thirsty every
314. hour, always longing more for water. And at last, at evening came the
315. longed for drink, but she dared not sip the full draught, she had to
316. turn away from the cool precious liquid, to thirst again. After a while
317. she thought she could not endure it. But the wind came flying, fanning
318. her, singing softly and gently, “Be brave, be brave! You will conquer!”
319. 
320. Day after day the Rose-bush gazed at the gleaming white house in which
321. lived people who had everything they wanted and then looked at the
322. street where others passed by with thin, pale faces that were tired and
323. sad, and this brought new strength to her heart.
324. 
325. She became constantly more sick and more weak; her arms hung down
326. feebly, her blossoms dropped their petals, her leaves became wrinkled
327. and yellow. The man who tended her watched her sadly and asked. “What
328. is wrong, my poor Rose-bush?” and he tried every remedy he knew of to
329. help her. But all in vain. One morning, instead of a handsome, blooming
330. Rose-bush, he found a miserable, withered, dead bush.
331. 
332. That could not remain there, the withered branches and flowers spoiled
333. the handsome garden. The gracious lady commanded that the Rose-bush be
334. thrown out. As the man dug her up, the Rose-bush gathered her remaining
335. strength and whispered beseechingly, “Take me home! Please, please take
336. me home!”
337. 
338. The man fulfilled her wish. He planted the Rose-bush in a flower pot
339. and took her to the poor, small room where he lived. His sick wife sat
340. up in bed and said, “Ah, the poor Rose-bush, she is as sick as I am,
341. but you will nurse us both back to health.”
342. 
343. The withered leaves and twigs moaned, “Water! Water!” And the man
344. understood them and brought in a jar of water. The Rose-bush drank. Oh!
345. what delight this was! Eagerly her roots sucked up the water, the
346. delicious moisture passing through all her branches gave her new life.
347. The next morning she could lift up her branches; the sick woman was as
348. happy as a child and cried, “She will get well!”
349. 
350. And the Rose-bush really got well. In a short while she again became so
351. beautiful that the poor little room was as fragrant as a garden. The
352. pale cheeks of the woman became rosier every day, her strength was
353. returning. “The Rose-bush has made me well,” said she, and all the
354. flowers on the Rose-bush glowed deep red with joy when she heard these
355. words.
356. 
357. The man and his wife were kind people, they gladly shared the little
358. they had, and carefully broke off some roses to bring joy to tired
359. people in other lonely rooms.
360. 
361. The roses had other magic powers; the Rose-bush, in her days of
362. struggle and suffering, had learned the songs of the Wind. Now her
363. flowers sang them very softly for their friends, “Keep together! Fight!
364. You will conquer!” Then the people said, “How strange! The perfume of
365. the flowers brings us new strength. We will fight together for a better
366. world.”
367. 
368. But to the little children the roses sang in a tender, loving voice:
369. “Little children, when you are grown up, you will no longer stand sadly
370. before the gate. The whole world will belong to those who work, the
371. whole world!”
372. 
373. 
374. 
375. 
376. 
377. 
378. 
379. 
380. THE SPARROW
381. 
382. 
383. Quarrel and disagreement ruled in the Sparrow family. Mother Sparrow
384. squatted unhappily in her nest all day and Father Sparrow swore and
385. grumbled and found fault with everything. The family that had once been
386. so gay and happy was completely changed. And for all this misery the
387. youngest Sparrow was to blame. One evening at supper he had declared,
388. briefly and boldly, “I’m not going to school any more. I’ve had enough
389. of being insulted by those aristocrats. Above all, I’m tired of all
390. this life. I want to go out into the world.” He stuck up his bill and
391. looked at his parents defiantly.
392. 
393. Mother Sparrow was so shocked that all her feathers stood up. She
394. started helplessly at her naughty son, and all she could do was to say
395. weakly, “Peep, peep.”
396. 
397. But Father Sparrow opened his mouth so wide in anger that the worm he
398. had meant to eat slid quickly away. He was a person of action, did not
399. believe in talking much, and proceeded to beat his son in the face with
400. his sharp beak.
401. 
402. The young Sparrow screamed more defiantly than ever, “I won’t stay here
403. any longer. I’ve had enough. I’m going out into the world.”
404. 
405. Then Mother Sparrow found her voice again and said tearfully, “You
406. wicked child! That’s how you thank your parents for their love. Haven’t
407. we brought you up well? You are the first sparrow in our village to
408. attend Professor Swallow’s school of architecture and learn to build
409. artistic nests. You belong to the best society and mingle with
410. Swallows, Starlings and Yellow-bills. And this is how you repay us.”
411. 
412. “I don’t care a pin about fine society,” replied the excited young
413. Sparrow. And he whistled defiantly, “Tweet, tweet!”
414. 
415. “No other Sparrow is studying such a respectable profession,”
416. despairingly piped Mother Sparrow.
417. 
418. Then the young Sparrow began to make such a fuss that the whole nest
419. shook. “A respectable profession, truly a beautiful profession. To
420. build nests in which others live. To slave in the heat of the sun,
421. carrying straws from all over, to weave them together, to see that
422. everything is just perfect—and then the fine ladies and gentlemen move
423. in, and throw me a little worm for my wages, hardly enough for a decent
424. meal. Above all, these fine people. The swallows, always dressed up in
425. their frock-coats; the Yellow-bills, always showing off their fine
426. jewelry. And how they treat our own people, full of pride and scorn.
427. Common laborer, they call me. I’ve had enough of it. I’m as good as
428. they are, and maybe better.”
429. 
430. Mother Sparrow shrank in horror, but Father Sparrow blew up until he
431. nearly burst and shouted, “Be silent, you lost soul, you
432. whipper-snapper. You talk like a Bolshevik. You forget that I am
433. chairman of the Council of Jesters. My son must not rebel against law
434. and order.”
435. 
436. “Yes,” exclaimed Mother Sparrow, “and suppose the neighbors should hear
437. you! How dreadful!”
438. 
439. The young Sparrow laughed shamelessly, seated himself on the edge of
440. the nest and whistled a revolutionary song.
441. 
442. Father Sparrow rose hastily and grumbled in an undertone to his wife,
443. “See to that young fool and make him behave. I must go to the meeting
444. of the Singing Society.” He flew away without one look at his naughty
445. son.
446. 
447. Mother Sparrow sighed deeply and asked in a complaining voice, “Now
448. what is it you really want?”
449. 
450. The young Sparrow came closer, nestled against his mother, and said
451. with a sweet smile, “I want to go away little mother, far away. To
452. foreign lands where it is always summer.”
453. 
454. “But son of my heart, you know that even the stupid children of men
455. learn in their schools that the Sparrow is not a migratory bird.”
456. 
457. “What is that to me? I can’t stand it here any longer. Always seeing
458. the same things; in the distance the old church steeple, here before
459. our noses the farm-house, and the dung-hill. No, I want to go away, far
460. away.”
461. 
462. At that he spread out his wings and pushed himself head first out of
463. the nest into space. It seemed very dangerous, but his wings carried
464. him safely through the air.
465. 
466. But the young Sparrow was by no means as joyous and light-hearted as he
467. seemed to be. The words of his parents had aroused all sorts of doubts
468. in his mind. “Mother was really right,” he said to himself. “The
469. Sparrow is not a migratory bird. No one has ever heard of a Sparrow
470. that has flown across the great ocean and gone to foreign lands. But
471. why shouldn’t I be the first one to do this?” he asked himself, with
472. defiant courage. “Some one must always be the first one. If my venture
473. succeeds, I will have proven to all the Sparrow folk that they need not
474. freeze and starve in the winter-time, but can move to the warm
475. countries and live happily. Certainly, the ocean....” The young
476. Sparrow’s heart lost courage, he thought of what his teacher, the
477. Swallow had once told him about the great, wild water that never seemed
478. to end, about the angry frothy waves over which one had to fly daily.
479. If one’s wings lost their strength, one fell down and was lost. One was
480. swallowed by the waves.
481. 
482. At these thoughts the Sparrow almost wanted to give up the idea. He
483. shrank together and began shivering. Then suddenly he thought how in
484. past hard winters many wretched Sparrows had died of hunger and cold.
485. 
486. “No, no,” said he to himself. “I must not be so cowardly. This matter
487. does not concern only myself, but all my brother Sparrows, all the
488. Sparrows of future generations, who will live when I have been long
489. dead. It will be worth every danger and every sacrifice if I can help
490. them to a happier life.”
491. 
492. And the brave young Sparrow decided to leave the next day.
493. 
494. He spent that night in his parents’ nest, nestled close to his mother,
495. wept a little secretly because it was hard for him to leave. Father
496. returned late, and he was quite drunk, threw himself on his bed so that
497. it cracked and fell asleep immediately.
498. 
499. The grey-white sky began to turn rosy, morning came flying on the wings
500. of the wind and brought light to the world. The young Sparrow awoke,
501. looked for the last time at his sleeping parents, and flew forth. He
502. knew in which direction he must fly, for he remembered the stories of
503. the Swallows. Now he flew exactly that way.
504. 
505. The sun climbed higher into the heavens, it became hotter and hotter,
506. the poor Sparrow could hardly breathe. His wings were so tired and sore
507. that he could hardly lift them. Still he flew further. He had resolved
508. not to rest until the shadows would fall upon the earth.
509. 
510. Never had he lived through so long a day. Vainly his bright little eyes
511. explored the heavens, but the great golden sphere of the sun shone
512. brightly, would not go down.
513. 
514. “I was a fool,” thought the Sparrow. “Now I might be sitting at home in
515. our nest, or be bathing in the puddle by the cherry-tree. Ah, how
516. pleasant it would be to bathe; at this moment even the ocean would not
517. be too large.”
518. 
519. Still he flew steadily on. But now he flew slowly, every beat of his
520. wings caused him dreadful pain. He began to hate the sun, this
521. merciless glowing red sphere that would not go down. To give himself
522. courage, he made up a little song, singing it very softly and moving
523. his tired wings in time to its rhythm.
524. 
525. 
526.            “My cause is the cause of my brothers,
527.             My strength must save them all;
528.             If I fail I do wrong to the others,
529.             And their chains will never fall.”
530. 
531. 
532. At last, at last, great black shadows fell upon the earth. A refreshing
533. breeze came flying, coolly fanning the weary Sparrow, carrying him
534. gently along on its mighty wings.
535. 
536. As the sun went down behind a blue hill, the tired Sparrow alighted on
537. a large meadow. He lay panting in the tall grass. The soft chirping of
538. the crickets lulled him to sleep; his eyes closed.
539. 
540. Rough, loud voices of men awakened him. Under a knotty old nut tree he
541. saw two ragged, dust-covered men seated. One of them pulled his torn
542. boots off, looked woefully at his blistered feet and said, “I can’t run
543. any more, I must rest a day.”
544. 
545. “Just another half hour,” the other man said comfortingly. “Just to the
546. next railroad station. There we will hide in a freight car and ride
547. until morning. Then it will not be far to the sea.”
548. 
549. The Sparrow had listened carefully to their conversation. “So people
550. get tired, too,” thought he, “and then they ride. I don’t know what
551. that means, but I know that one does not tire oneself that way. If
552. people ride, why shouldn’t Sparrows also ride?” He decided to follow
553. the men, and since they left in a short time he flew after them.
554. 
555. They arrived at a house in front of which two shining bands were
556. stretched on the ground. Now night had really come. All was hidden in
557. darkness, only the stars shone faintly in the sky. The Sparrow stayed
558. near the two men and waited.
559. 
560. Suddenly something dreadful appeared. Through the darkness a gigantic
561. black beast came rattling, its red eyes shining so brightly that one
562. could see them from a great distance, it puffed and panted, the earth
563. shook after it. It shrieked frightfully as it came near. Then suddenly
564. it stopped. It let out clouds of smoke from its long black nose.
565. 
566. The Sparrow was astonished that neither of the two men, nor the rest of
567. the people, seemed to be afraid of the monster. On the contrary, they
568. ran up to it, disappearing in its smoke. Then the Sparrow saw that the
569. monster pulled some black houses behind it. He saw the two men sneak
570. into one of these houses and flew on to the roof of the same house.
571. Scarcely had he settled himself when the monster again began to puff
572. and pant and started on its journey.
573. 
574. The poor Sparrow thought he would die of fright. The monster rushed
575. with such speed that the little bird could not hear or see. At home he
576. had often flown with the wind for the sport of it and had enjoyed the
577. swift motion. But this was altogether different. He made himself very
578. small, settled himself firmly, and believed his last hour had come. If
579. men called this rest they surely are strange creatures. Perhaps it
580. wasn’t so terrible where the people were. He was a clever Sparrow and
581. when the monster stopped again to take breath, he flew down from the
582. roof of the house and examined it. The door was not quite closed. The
583. Sparrow squeezed through the crack, entered a dark room where many
584. boxes were piled. He squatted on one of the chests and waited to see
585. what would happen.
586. 
587. The monster began to run again. The Sparrow laughed with joy; now he
588. had guessed right. He sat here quietly, comfortably, and the monster
589. had to slave to carry him further. So this is what people call “to
590. ride.” Truly, people are not so stupid as he had thought.
591. 
592. The countless feet of the monster pounded over the earth singing a
593. rattling, rumbling, monotonous song. The Sparrow understood the words
594. to mean “Into the distance! Into the distance!” For a while he listened
595. to the song, then he fell asleep.
596. 
597. He must have slept a long time. When he awoke the sun was high in the
598. sky and its rays came into the dark room through narrow cracks in the
599. door. The Sparrow saw that his two acquaintances had hidden themselves
600. between two tall boxes. They seemed to be in good humor, chatting with
601. one another and laughing.
602. 
603. “We have traveled a good part of our journey without trouble,” said the
604. older one. “Now we only have to walk another day and ride another
605. night. Then we will reach the ocean.”
606. 
607. “How long will we have to swim?”
608. 
609. “About five days.”
610. 
611. The Sparrow was frightened. Five days he would have to swim over the
612. endless waters, five long days he could not rest or cease if he wished
613. to save himself from sinking into the waves. How could he endure it? He
614. began to reflect carefully. Could men swim so long in water? He had
615. seen boys bathing in the village pond, yet they would come out of the
616. water in a short time and none of them ever remained in the water all
617. day long. But perhaps there were also tame monsters which carried men
618. over the water. Again he decided not to leave the two men and to do
619. everything they did.
620. 
621. When the two men jumped, unnoticed, off the freight train at a railway
622. station, the Sparrow followed them. He flew very close to them. He felt
623. that they were both his friends and so long as he would not leave them
624. nothing would happen to him.
625. 
626. All day long the men journeyed, walking through fields and meadows,
627. through little villages with queer pointed church steeples. The younger
628. of the two men limped, he could only walk slowly. This was very
629. pleasing to the Sparrow, because he did not have to move fast, he could
630. fly comfortably. When the men stopped, the Sparrow followed their
631. example, meantime seeking his food, as the long journey made him
632. unusually hungry. He also chatted with a few strange birds, all of whom
633. advised him not to continue his dangerous journey. The migratory birds
634. looked him over scornfully, saying with a sneer, “Do you believe you
635. can do the same as we distinguished people? To travel, to see the
636. world, to spend the winter in warm countries—that is not for common
637. people.”
638. 
639. An old blackbird minister, black-frocked and solemn, delivered a sermon
640. to him from a branch. “We must obey God’s commandments. God has
641. ordained that Sparrows must spend the winter in the north.”
642. 
643. “If God has decreed that all our people shall freeze and starve and
644. that only the aristocrats, the Capitalists, like the Swallows and
645. Starlings, shall fly away to the warm places, I don’t want to know
646. anything about him!” cried the Sparrow and his feathers bristled up in
647. anger.
648. 
649. The old blackbird minister primped his shining feathers with his bill
650. and growled senselessly. But the Sparrow was sad. “How cruel the birds
651. are to one another,” he thought to himself. “I want to do something
652. that will help all and am just laughed at. Can’t anybody understand
653. me?”
654. 
655. “Hark, hark!” called a soft voice from a great height, and a young Lark
656. shot downward as swift as lightning to the side of the sad Sparrow. “I
657. understand you. Everybody jeers at me too, because I don’t fly close to
658. the earth like they do, but always seek to fly higher and higher, into
659. the blue sky. Do not be downcast, beloved brother, you will reach your
660. goal.”
661. 
662. The young Lark flew quite close to the Sparrow, looked at him and said,
663. “Fly a little for me, brother, so I can see how strong your wings are.”
664. 
665. The Sparrow flew up, hovering over the Lark.
666. 
667. As he returned she looked at him sadly and said earnestly, “Your wings
668. cannot carry you over the great ocean, my poor friend. But you must not
669. give up on account of that, you must do as men do, who cannot fly and
670. yet travel all over the world. They have invented a sort of house that
671. swims over the water. They call it a ship. You must....”
672. 
673. The Sparrow did not wait to hear the end. The two men had left during
674. the conversation, and now the Sparrow saw them in the distance looking
675. like two dark spots. Frightened, he cried. “My two men have left me,”
676. and he flew after them as fast as he could.
677. 
678. When it grew dark, the men once again sneaked into a freight train. The
679. Sparrow followed them and slept all night, while the black monster
680. again took him over hills and mountains, past rivers and streams.
681. 
682. As dawn came, the two men crept out of the train and the Sparrow flew
683. after them. They walked for a little while, then the Sparrow saw an
684. immense body of water lying before him. Endless, extending beyond his
685. vision, this blue-gray body of water extended, and on its surface
686. stormed wild, white-capped, monstrously high billows.
687. 
688. So this was the ocean! Never had the Sparrow felt so small and helpless
689. as at the sight of this dreadful water. What was he in comparison to
690. this? A poor, helpless little bird, a tiny something. Deep sighs lifted
691. his little breast, from his bright eyes the tears fell. “If I were only
692. at home, in the safe little nest,” cried he to himself. “I could creep
693. under mother’s wings as I did when I was little.”
694. 
695. The waves roared dismally, threateningly; the white froth squirted
696. upwards. The two men walked unconcernedly on the damp, sandy ground.
697. With beating heart the Sparrow followed them. And then he saw something
698. surprising. In a great bay some strange things tossed. They were
699. something like a house, but had few windows and tall chimneys from
700. which streamed heavy grey smoke; some things that looked like a forest;
701. bare trees without branches seemed to grow in it. Although these trees
702. bore neither fruit not leaves, the Sparrow was delighted to see them.
703. They gave him confidence. He began to feel at home. But how strange it
704. was that these houses with trees on them were tossed up and down by the
705. waves. Suddenly the Sparrow remembered the words of the Lark. “Men call
706. these houses that swim on the water ‘ships’.” So these were ships! On
707. one of these tossing, swimming houses he would journey to warm lands.
708. 
709. But which should he choose?
710. 
711. It occurred to him that at home the largest trees could best withstand
712. the wind. Evidently the same was true of ships, and so he must choose
713. the largest.
714. 
715. His two friends went to a small ship, and the Sparrow piped, “Good
716. luck! Good luck!” but they did not hear him.
717. 
718. The Sparrow flew on to an immense ship from whose chimneys streamed
719. great clouds of grey smoke, and hid himself high up at the top of one
720. of the leafless trees.
721. 
722. What noise and excitement there was below. Countless people ran hither
723. and thither, calling and shouting to one another; something rattled,
724. something clattered, the great chimneys shrieked loudly. A bridge that
725. attached the boat to the land flew up into the air, then fell into the
726. boat with a bang. The boat started on its journey. Slowly, solemnly it
727. cut through the water that bubbled on either side. The large house with
728. the leafless trees, the little bird’s new home, swam away from the
729. land.
730. 
731. The Sparrow’s mind was quite confused with the noise and hurry. And now
732. another great fright came to him. Suddenly a young fellow climbed up
733. his tree. The Sparrow believed that he wanted to capture him, but the
734. fellow didn’t seem to notice him and after a little while climbed back.
735. As it grew dark, the boat became quiet and one could only hear the
736. noise of the waves. The Sparrow flew down from his tree and sat down on
737. the roof, where he soon fell asleep.
738. 
739. When he awoke in the morning, he thought he would die of fear. The land
740. had disappeared. Wherever he looked he saw only water; great grey waves
741. rolled against the ship, shaking it gently as a soft wind shakes the
742. nests in the trees. Nowhere a tree, a shrub, a flower. The boat swam
743. all alone on the great ocean, that would not end.
744. 
745. The poor Sparrow felt quite lonesome and deserted. “If I could just
746. find any bird,” sighed he. “Even if it were a haughty Swallow or a
747. strange Blackbird. At least I could speak with some one who knows my
748. world, who speaks my language.” Finally he lost all his courage and
749. began to weep bitterly.
750. 
751. “Who are you?” suddenly asked a thin, piping voice, and the Sparrow
752. beheld a little mouse standing before him, who stared at him with large
753. round eyes.
754. 
755. The Sparrow was happy, for he was acquainted with mice at home. He bent
756. down and hopefully answered the questions of the mouse.
757. 
758. “You are a brave Sparrow,” she said, after she had heard his story. “I
759. bid you welcome to my ship.”
760. 
761. “To your ship?” exclaimed the Sparrow. “I thought that the ship belongs
762. to the people.”
763. 
764. “The people also believe that,” replied the Mouse sharply. “But don’t
765. you know that people believe that everything belongs to them?”
766. 
767. “That is true. The farmer at home believed that the church-steeple was
768. his, and yet it is quite clear that the church-steeple was made for us
769. Sparrows.”
770. 
771. While they were speaking thus, a very old mouse came over and began to
772. speak. “Not all people believe that everything belongs to them,” said
773. she learnedly. “There are also people who do not possess anything. You
774. can observe that on the ship. Above live people in large, beautiful
775. rooms, and eat all day long. My mouth waters when I smell the rich
776. foods that are set before them.”
777. 
778. “But down below the people are crowded together, so that they can
779. hardly find place to lie down at night, and many have only dry bread
780. along with them to eat on the whole journey. This stupid phrase ‘my
781. boat’ you have also learned from men,” she said scolding the mouse.
782. “You know that the common things are ours. Don’t let me hear false
783. words from you.”
784. 
785. “Excuse me, grandmother,” begged the young Mouse.
786. 
787. “You are a stranger here,” said the Grandmother Mouse to the Sparrow.
788. “We will be helpful to you, so that you can endure the long journey. I
789. advise you not to fly to the rich people, they will play with you a day
790. or two, and then forget you. Indeed, it is only among the poor people,
791. on the lower deck, that you will find a few breadcrumbs, and these
792. people will be good to you because they know how a poor, unfortunate
793. creature feels.”
794. 
795. The Sparrow followed the advice of the wise Grandmother Mouse and soon
796. realized that she had spoken truthfully. The children were delighted
797. with him, and they spared him breadcrumbs from the few that were
798. provided for their own little mouths. And because they were children,
799. they understood the language of the Sparrow, and chatted with him. In
800. this way the Sparrow heard many sad stories. The children told of
801. poverty and distress, how hard parents had to work and how often there
802. was nothing to eat at home. The honest Sparrow felt very sad to hear
803. this. “There must also be a beautiful land for men, where conditions
804. are good and they do not have to hunger and freeze,” said he to his
805. little friend.
806. 
807. “Perhaps,” said a pale little girl. “But we have not yet found the road
808. to it.”
809. 
810. “When I am big,” declared a little boy dressed in black, “then I will
811. go out to search for that land. When I find it I will lead all the poor
812. people to it.”
813. 
814. The two mice also visited the Sparrow often, they always came towards
815. evening, when all was quiet.
816. 
817. So passed a long time, and one day the Sparrow saw land in the
818. distance, saw houses and trees and knew that now his goal was reached.
819. 
820. The grey ocean had become quite blue and gleamed in the sunshine. It
821. was very hot, and Grandmother Mouse said that in this land there was no
822. winter.
823. 
824. When the ship landed, the Sparrow flew after his friends for a while
825. and then contemplated his new home.
826. 
827. All the people had brown faces and wore strange clothes. The faces of
828. the women were covered so that one could only see their large black
829. eyes. He also saw queer animals that walked on four legs and had great
830. humps on their backs. Even the trees were different than those at home,
831. there were some with long pointed leaves and brown fruit that the
832. Sparrow relished. There was plenty to eat; here no Sparrow had to
833. suffer hunger, and there was no snow or cold.
834. 
835. “Isn’t this also the right country for the poor people?” the Sparrow
836. asked himself. But then he saw that in this sunny land there were also
837. rich and poor, that some were richly dressed and others wore rags, that
838. some lazy ones rode in handsome carriages and some dragged heavy
839. burdens. And he thought, “It is much easier to find a Sparrow paradise
840. than a land in which people may enjoy happiness.” This pained him,
841. because on his journey he had learned to love the poor people. “But how
842. strange this is. People can tame wild animals to carry them through all
843. lands, they know how to build houses that swim on the water and yet
844. they are so poor and destitute and let a few evil wretches take
845. everything for themselves.”
846. 
847. Now that he had reached the warm country, the Sparrow rested from his
848. long and wearisome journey, flew about lazily, and spent each night in
849. a different tree.
850. 
851. One day he came to a beautiful green stream and flew along its course.
852. He came to a great, large plain. At first he thought he had reached the
853. ocean again, but as far as he could see lay fine yellow sand. In the
854. distance he saw something rising out of the sand which looked like a
855. monstrous animal. He flew closer to it and saw that it really was a
856. gigantic creature with the head of a human being and two large paws. It
857. was made of grey-brown stone and was partly covered with sand.
858. 
859. The ugly animal lay quite still and grinned angrily. The Sparrow
860. curtseyed carefully: would the beast wish to eat him? But no, it
861. graciously acknowledged his greeting and said: “I have been lying here
862. thousands of years, yet I have never seen a bird like you. Who are you?
863. What are you doing here?”
864. 
865. The Sparrow related his story and the great beast listened patiently.
866. Then the little bird inquired, “Will you tell me who you are? We have
867. no animals like you at home.”
868. 
869. The great beast laughed and replied, “People call me the Sphinx. I am
870. so old that I have lost count of my years; have seen everything, know
871. everything.”
872. 
873. “In my country the Owls say that, too,” was the Sparrow’s pert remark.
874. 
875. The Sphinx looked at him angrily. “The Owl is a conceited boaster!” he
876. cried excitedly.
877. 
878. “Excuse me!” stammered the Sparrow, frightened. “I did not wish to
879. insult you. You look much older than the Owl.”
880. 
881. “Indeed I am. I count my years by the thousands.”
882. 
883. “How much you must have seen!” cried the Sparrow.
884. 
885. The Sphinx opened her gigantic mouth and yawned so hugely that the sand
886. flew about her as though a whirlwind had hit it.
887. 
888. “Since the year 1000,” said she. “I always see the same; I see people
889. who have riches and joy, forcing their starving slaves to drudge. At
890. first the slaves were driven with whips which the overseer used to beat
891. them with when they became tired from the heat of the sun. Often these
892. slaves were kept at work with chains on their feet so that they should
893. not run away. Later the whips disappeared, the masters bragged of their
894. kindness, saying, ‘In these progressive times, no man is a slave.’ But
895. secretly they concealed a dreadful whip, Hunger, and this drove the
896. people to slavery as surely as the whip they had used previously. I see
897. people pass here, rich strangers who visit this country out of
898. curiosity, and see the poor Arabs, who work as muleteers and drag heavy
899. stones, and are barely kept alive with a few dates and a little corn,
900. just like their ancestors thousands of years ago.”
901. 
902. The Sphinx became silent, gazing gloomily at the desert. Then she spoke
903. again, “For thousands of years there were gorgeously dressed, jeweled
904. priests here, who belonged in the same class as the rich people. They
905. preached to the people, threatening them with the anger of the gods if
906. they became dissatisfied with their fate. Today these priests are
907. dressed in black, but they also lie and stand by the rich ones, they
908. also worship a God who was a bad mechanic. It has always been the same,
909. for thousands of years.” And again the Sphinx yawned.
910. 
911. “Can’t you also see into the future, wise Beast?” bashfully questioned
912. the Sparrow.
913. 
914. “Yes, I can also see that. Listen to my words, little bird. A day will
915. come when all slaves will arise in a dreadful struggle against their
916. oppressors. After long bloody battles they will conquer and then there
917. will be a new world, where everything belongs to all the people and all
918. people are free. Even today the earth trembles in happy expectation,
919. and in the quiet night I feel its trembling. For thousands of years I
920. have not spoken to any being, I will only speak again when the day of
921. freedom dawns. Then my voice will join in the jubilations of the freed
922. people.”
923. 
924. The Sparrow flew out of the desert where he could find nothing to eat,
925. back to the green stream, and enjoyed many pleasant days there.
926. 
927. One day he was sitting on a stone on the bank of the stream, when he
928. heard familiar voices, “Tweet! Tweet!”
929. 
930. He looked up and saw three Swallows who flew slowly toward him.
931. 
932. “Are you here already?” the Sparrow asked in surprise.
933. 
934. “Certainly, certainly,” twittered the Swallows. “At home rough winds
935. are blowing, the frost is in the meadows at night, winter is coming.”
936. 
937. How frightened the Sparrow was at that. Here in this beautiful land
938. where he had plenty of fat worms and warm sunshine, he had forgotten
939. about his Sparrow brothers. And in the meantime the deadly winter had
940. come! He must rush home to teach them how to reach the sunny land.
941. Would he reach there in time? How selfish he had been; if Sparrows were
942. freezing and starving at home, it was his fault.
943. 
944. Even while he was thinking this he spread out his little wings and flew
945. toward the ocean.
946. 
947. In the harbor many silvery-white Seagulls flew about, crying with
948. shrill voices, “A storm is coming! A storm is coming!”
949. 
950. “Which ship is going north?” he asked hastily.
951. 
952. “None,” answered a Seagull; but this was not true, they were
953. disagreeable birds and wanted to frighten the Sparrow.
954. 
955. But he believed them. “Then I must fly over the ocean,” thought he,
956. fearfully. “I must do it, for on me depends the life or death of my
957. Sparrow brothers. I must make good.”
958. 
959. Sadly he looked back once more on the wonderland; then flew out on the
960. great waters.
961. 
962. Wild waves dashed up, the storm howled and rain fell. In a few hours,
963. the Sparrow was so tired that he could no longer fly high. The billows
964. made his feathers wet, they were heavy with the water and drew him
965. deeper and deeper down. A monstrous wave reached out for him with white
966. arms and the Sparrow fell into the ocean and was swallowed by the
967. waves.
968. 
969. For that reason the Sparrows must still freeze and starve every winter,
970. for there has not been another courageous Sparrow to show them the way
971. to the sunny country.
972. 
973. But had the Sparrow suffered so much and died in vain?
974. 
975. No, the little black-haired boy on the ship had paid special attention
976. to the story which the Sparrow had told him and had listened to what
977. the Sparrow wanted to do for his Sparrow brothers, and this the little
978. boy wanted to do for his fellow-humans. He grew up, and wherever
979. oppressed workers struggled against their oppressors, he was the
980. leader. But the story of the black-haired boy, of his life and his
981. death, is another tale and does not belong here.

989. 
990. THE LITTLE GREY DOG
991. 
992. 
993. He was an ugly grey dog with long silken-soft ears and a bushy tail. He
994. was born in a splendid stable that belonged to a rich man. This rich
995. man lived on a large estate in which were fields and meadows. And in
996. these fields grew sugarcane, in great quantities, great, round, smooth
997. canes that contained the sweet sugar. On the sugar plantations worked
998. hundreds of Negroes, men and women, and the Negroes belonged to the
999. rich man who had bought them in the market as he would buy cattle, for
1000. this story happened long ago, in those days when slavery existed in
1001. America. The rich man could do anything he wished with his slaves. If
1002. he was in a bad mood he would permit them to be whipped; if they dared
1003. to protest against this cruel treatment they were more cruelly
1004. punished—they were stripped naked, smeared with honey, and tied to a
1005. tree. The smell of the honey attracted the bees that came in large
1006. swarms, settled on the body of the slave, sucked the honey and stung
1007. the bound man till he collapsed with pain. Also, the master could sell
1008. his slave, did this frequently, without the least consideration,
1009. tearing mother from child, separating man and wife, sister and brother.
1010. The poor Negroes were completely helpless, they had to work all day
1011. long in the hot sun, received very poor food, lived in wretched huts,
1012. separated from the house of the rich man by a mighty river. Here lived
1013. the Negroes, crowded together; the children played about in front of
1014. these huts, played happily, because they did not yet know that they
1015. were slaves and that a hard, difficult life awaited them.
1016. 
1017. In one of the Negro huts arrived the little grey dog who had been born
1018. in the splendid stable, and this is how it happened.
1019. 
1020. Once when the rich man walked through the stable, he noticed the little
1021. grey dog who was playing in the straw. He examined the little dog, and
1022. said angrily to the coachman, “What is this ugly little creature doing
1023. here in my beautiful stable? Take it out, drown it in the river.”
1024. 
1025. The coachman promised to do this; indeed he pitied the lively little
1026. animal, but the master was strict and he did not dare to disobey the
1027. command. He called the little dog, who came running joyously, and
1028. started toward the river. As he came near the homes of the slaves, a
1029. little black boy ran out of one of the huts and cried, “O, the lovely
1030. little animal! Where are you taking it?” And he ran quite close to them
1031. and patted the dog, who mischievously jumped at him, barking.
1032. 
1033. “I must drown the dog,” answered the coachman.
1034. 
1035. At that the eyes of the little boy filled with tears, he took the dog
1036. in his arms, held him close, and begged, “Don’t do it, just see how
1037. darling he is!”
1038. 
1039. “I must do it, Benjamin. The master has commanded me. If I don’t obey
1040. him he will punish me severely.”
1041. 
1042. The little grey dog licked Benjamin’s face, looked at him with his
1043. large eyes that seemed to implore him, “Save me, save me!”
1044. 
1045. “Give me the dog,” pleaded Benjamin. “I will hide him well so that the
1046. master will not see him.”
1047. 
1048. The coachman thought for a moment, then replied, “Good, you may hide
1049. him. But,” he said warningly, “you must not betray the fact that I have
1050. given him to you. If the master should ever see him, you must say that
1051. you saved him from the river. Then he will give you a bad beating....”
1052. 
1053. “That doesn’t matter,” cried Benjamin eagerly. “As long as the little
1054. dog is allowed to live.”
1055. 
1056. The coachman laughed, removed the string from the neck of the dog, and
1057. Benjamin ran to the hut with him, patting him, kissing him, full of
1058. joy. At evening when Benjamin’s parents came home, he showed them the
1059. dog, and the parents also were happy because they had to be away from
1060. home all day and always feared that the little boy might go to the
1061. river, fall in and be drowned. But now he would stay near the huts with
1062. his playfellow, so that he might hide himself quickly in case the rich
1063. man might pass by.
1064. 
1065. It was as though the little grey dog knew that Benjamin had saved his
1066. life. He did not leave the side of the little boy, obeyed him, and
1067. showed himself to be quite intelligent. Benjamin spoke to him like to a
1068. person, and the dog looked at him as wisely as though he understood
1069. every word.
1070. 
1071. Benjamin’s parents were young and strong, the best workers on the sugar
1072. plantation. Therefore the severe overseer was satisfied with them and
1073. beat them less often than he did the other slaves. On that account they
1074. were both, in spite of their hard life, satisfied, and in the evenings
1075. when they returned to their hut and their little Benjamin, all three of
1076. them were gay and happy.
1077. 
1078. Benjamin’s mother Hannah was also an excellent seamstress, she knew how
1079. to weave pretty baskets from reeds and rushes, and was a very good
1080. cook.
1081. 
1082. One day the eldest daughter of the rich man, who lived with her husband
1083. in the north, come to visit her father. She was glad to see her old
1084. home again and everything seemed to her more beautiful than in the
1085. north. She complained of the trouble she had in getting servants in the
1086. city. “These whites are not nearly as desirable as the blacks,” said
1087. she. “They cannot be driven to work with whips. You should present me
1088. with a good slave, father, so that it will be more comfortable for me.
1089. My husband will be quite angry about it, for the people in the north
1090. are crazy, they claim that the blacks are also human beings, and that
1091. slavery must be abolished. But he loves me dearly, and will be glad if
1092. he sees me happy.”
1093. 
1094. The rich man thought a while and said, “The young slaves that I own are
1095. all clumsy, incapable; the old ones of course could not become
1096. accustomed to living in a large city and would be more trouble than
1097. help to you. Whom can I give you?”
1098. 
1099. He considered for a moment, then cried happily, “Now I know, Hannah is
1100. just the right one for you. How could I forget her? Of course, she has
1101. a little boy....”
1102. 
1103. “I don’t want him,” the daughter interrupted. “My dear little son must
1104. not play with a dirty Negro child. You can keep Hannah’s son here.”
1105. 
1106. “You are a good mother, my beloved child,” said the rich man, moved.
1107. “You always think of your son. Good, Benjamin shall remain here and
1108. when you go back to the city tomorrow, I will give you Hannah to take
1109. along. I will immediately tell the overseer, so that he may tell her to
1110. be ready.”
1111. 
1112. And the rich man called a servant and bade him bring the overseer.
1113. 
1114. Ah, what a sad night that was in the little hut of the Negroes. Poor
1115. Hannah hugged her little son close in her arms and cried as though her
1116. heart would break. Her husband Tom gazed at her with worried eyes and
1117. was so miserable that he could not say a word. Hannah kept looking
1118. anxiously toward the little window, trembling with the fear of seeing
1119. the first ray of light that meant that day was near, when she would
1120. leave her loved ones.
1121. 
1122. The little grey dog seemed to understand the grief of his friends, he
1123. nestled quite close to Hannah’s coat, looking up at them with loving,
1124. clever eyes. Then Hannah cried loudly, “If they sell you, too, Tom,
1125. what will become of our poor child?” The little dog laid his paw on
1126. little Benjamin as though to say, “Don’t fear, poor mother, I will take
1127. care of him.”
1128. 
1129. Hannah noticed this, sobbingly patted the shaggy head of the dog, and
1130. said to him, “Guard my little boy, you good dog. We are all as helpless
1131. and deserted as you.”
1132. 
1133. The following morning, poor Hannah, weeping bitterly, rode off with the
1134. young woman. Her family was not allowed to see her off, for Tom had to
1135. work in the field and Benjamin, like all the slaves, was forbidden to
1136. come near the house of the rich man.
1137. 
1138. Little Benjamin lived through many sad days. His father was so unhappy
1139. that he no longer wanted to work, and many evenings he would return
1140. home with his back all bloody. Instead of the caressing and joy to
1141. which Benjamin was accustomed there was an unaccustomed silence in the
1142. house. Tom sat sadly on the ground, sometimes stroking sadly the wooly
1143. head of his little son, but never speaking. Only once in a while he
1144. would cry out, “Hannah!” and sigh deeply, while great tears rolled down
1145. his black face. And sometimes he would clench his fist, looking so
1146. angry that Benjamin took the little dog and crawled into a corner with
1147. him.
1148. 
1149. The overseer was always unsatisfied with Tom, he complained to the
1150. master of the laziness and obstinacy of the slave. Had poor Tom known
1151. the results of his disobedience, he would have worked as industriously
1152. as he used to, in spite of his anger and unhappiness.
1153. 
1154. The rich man celebrated his birthday. There was a great feast, chickens
1155. and calves and lambs were roasted, rich foods could be smelled all
1156. through the house, the servants brought countless bottles from the
1157. wine-cellar. After supper the young guests danced in the large hall,
1158. the older men seated themselves at a table and began to play cards.
1159. 
1160. The rich man had no luck, he lost again and again, until at last his
1161. purse was empty. “One more game,” said he to his friend who had won all
1162. the money, “We will gamble for my strongest and best slave.” And he
1163. thought to himself, “If I lose Tom, that will not be a misfortune, for
1164. lately he is lazy and obstinate, anyhow.”
1165. 
1166. His friend agreed. The whole life and fate of a human being depended
1167. upon a few cards, a bundle of paper. The rich man drew a card, his
1168. friend did the same. They threw the cards on the table. The rich man
1169. had lost.
1170. 
1171. When Tom came to work the following morning, the overseer told him to
1172. go to the house of the rich man, the master had sold him and his new
1173. master would take him to his estate at once.
1174. 
1175. That evening Benjamin waited in vain for the return of his father.
1176. Night came, it was quite dark, and his father did not come. Benjamin
1177. sat huddled on the threshold, peering anxiously into the darkness. The
1178. little grey dog lay near him. He was sad and quiet, he seemed to feel
1179. that something was wrong. At last Benjamin could stand it no longer,
1180. ran crying to the hut of a neighbor, and asked about his father. The
1181. stout negress informed him that a strange master had taken Tom with him
1182. that morning; he was sold and would not return.
1183. 
1184. Benjamin went home crying, afraid of the dark, holding the little dog,
1185. his only friend, tight in his arms. And now something strange happened.
1186. When Benjamin, sobbing, started to tell the little dog of this sorrow,
1187. the dog began to bark softly. But it was not an ordinary bark, but
1188. speech, and Benjamin understood very well the words, “Don’t cry, little
1189. friend, I will take care of you and guard you. And some day we will go
1190. to search for your parents.”
1191. 
1192. Benjamin was so astonished at this, that he stopped crying. “What!”
1193. cried he, surprised, “you can speak, like a human being?”
1194. 
1195. The dog shook his shaggy head. “Yes, when the rich people act like wild
1196. beasts against the poor people, we animals must help them. When a human
1197. being is very unhappy and forsaken, he understands our language and
1198. knows that we wish him well. I have not forgotten, little Benjamin,
1199. that you saved my life. I want to thank you. Lie down on the straw,
1200. sleep, I will watch over you.”
1201. 
1202. A little comforted, the little boy obeyed, and the dog sat down near
1203. him, guarding him all night, licking Benjamin’s hand with his warm
1204. tongue occasionally.
1205. 
1206. Then came hard times for little Benjamin. The stout lady who was his
1207. neighbor took him to her hut, but she was not good to him. She forced
1208. him to carry water from the river in a heavy bucket, and made him do
1209. all kinds of hard work. And the worst was yet to come. One day the rich
1210. man passed by the huts of the Negroes and saw Benjamin. “A strong boy,”
1211. he said. “He can work in the fields already.” And from then on the
1212. little boy had to work in the fields in the heat of the sun till he
1213. thought he would die of weariness.
1214. 
1215. At evening, tired, he would crawl into the hut, bury his head in the
1216. hide of the grey dog, cry, and draw comfort from his only friend.
1217. 
1218. One evening, his back all bloody and his face swollen, Benjamin came
1219. home. The overseer had been in a bad temper, had beaten the little boy
1220. with a whip and hit him in the face with his fist.
1221. 
1222. “I want to die,” cried Benjamin, while the dog softly and gently licked
1223. his wounds. “I can’t stand it any longer. My parents are gone, I am
1224. entirely deserted, everyone is unkind to me. Dog, dear dog, what shall
1225. I do?”
1226. 
1227. “Run away,” replied the dog.
1228. 
1229. “Where to? They will catch me and beat me again.”
1230. 
1231. The dog thought hard for a while.
1232. 
1233. “We must go north,” said he at last. “There people are better than they
1234. are here. They do not want the Negroes to be slaves. We must run away
1235. there.”
1236. 
1237. “I don’t know the way,” complained Benjamin.
1238. 
1239. “I will lead you. Morning and night, when everybody is asleep, we will
1240. go.”
1241. 
1242. And so it happened. The moon was a small white sickle in the sky, the
1243. great trees tossed weird, black shadows on the earth, all was deathly
1244. quiet, only once in a while the leaves rustled sleepily. Benjamin and
1245. the dog ran softly on their tiptoes, out of the hut, and went toward
1246. the great river. All night they wandered along the side of the river,
1247. and when morning came the dog looked for a safe hiding place, for the
1248. short legs of little Benjamin had not carried him very far, and there
1249. was still the danger that the servants of the rich man might trace him.
1250. 
1251. While the dog was running restlessly back and forth to find a safe
1252. place, Benjamin sat on the bank of the river, letting his tired,
1253. burning feet hang in the water. Suddenly he was dreadfully frightened
1254. and drew his feet back hastily. A large pointed head thrust itself
1255. through the water, a gigantic mouth opened, showing two rows of
1256. dreadful teeth, and a deep voice growled, “A fine morsel, just right
1257. for breakfast.”
1258. 
1259. Benjamin screamed aloud and the dog came running quickly to him. Though
1260. he was himself a little frightened, he whispered to Benjamin, “That is
1261. an alligator. Step back and let me speak to him.”
1262. 
1263. The little boy obeyed and the dog addressed himself with cajoling
1264. courtesy to the alligator, saying, “Excuse us for having come to your
1265. kingdom, mighty lord of the river, but we are fleeing from evil people
1266. and know that you with your power will be good enough to defend us.”
1267. 
1268. The alligator felt flattered, drew his gigantic mouth into a friendly
1269. grin, and replied politely, “You are a clever animal. I am truly more
1270. mighty than people, and,” he agreed pensively, “neither are we as bad
1271. as they. But this creature that sat with his feet hanging in the water
1272. is also a human being. Then why is he running away from his brothers?”
1273. And the shiny, greenish eyes of the alligator looked distrustfully at
1274. the dog.
1275. 
1276. “You surely know, wise and mighty animal, that the rich people are
1277. merciless to the poor, as though they were the wildest beasts. That is
1278. because there is no more greedy animal than this man. He is never
1279. satisfied, he always wants more: food and drink and houses, but above
1280. all, gold. That makes him so mean. My little friend is a poor child who
1281. must work for a rich man. He was torn away from his parents, and beaten
1282. until the blood flowed. I advised him to run away. And now we beg that
1283. you help us, for any moment the servants of the rich man may appear and
1284. capture my little friend.”
1285. 
1286. The alligator shook his pointed head thoughtfully and said: “People are
1287. peculiar creatures. No alligator would torment a little alligator,
1288. neither do we know the difference between rich and poor, and still it
1289. is said that we are evil animals. It is true that I would like to eat
1290. your little friend for breakfast, yet I will be merciful to him. I will
1291. also show you a safe hiding place. Do you see that little island? The
1292. servants of the rich man will not find you there.”
1293. 
1294. “We thank you, mighty animal; but how can we reach the island? The
1295. water is rough and deep, and my little friend can’t swim.”
1296. 
1297. “I will carry you over on my back,” answered the alligator.
1298. 
1299. Benjamin and the dog seated themselves on the scaly back of the animal,
1300. and it began to swim. What a strange journey that was! The waves played
1301. over the back of the alligator and the dog was afraid that the
1302. alligator might change his mind and eat both of them for breakfast. For
1303. that reason he spoke continuously to the alligator, flattered him,
1304. praised his goodness and declared solemnly that the alligators are the
1305. noblest animals in the world. This trick did not fail in its purpose.
1306. When they landed on the island, the alligator called twelve of the
1307. strongest alligators to him, instructing them that they must not harm a
1308. hair on the boy or the dog, that they were his guests. He also
1309. commanded them to swim along the bank of the river  and stand guard,
1310. keeping the people from coming to the island. This was well done, for
1311. when the sun was high in the heavens, five men appeared, sent by the
1312. rich man to look for Benjamin. One pointed to the island, started to go
1313. into the water, when an immense alligator pushed his head out of the
1314. water and the man crept back. “He can’t be there,” said the man to his
1315. companions. “The alligators here must have eaten him.”
1316. 
1317. Benjamin and the dog rested all day on the island. The little boy ate
1318. the sweet berries that grew there, drank from a well, and at evening
1319. the alligator carried them back again to the bank and bade them a
1320. friendly farewell.
1321. 
1322. Today traveling was more difficult than it had been yesterday, for
1323. Benjamin’s feet were blistered, he groaned and complained at every
1324. step. The dog comforted him, encouraged him, let him ride on his back a
1325. little while though the boy was too heavy and after a few minutes the
1326. dog’s bones would crack and he would have to lie down. Deep sorrow
1327. tormented the dog, surely the servants of the rich man were somewhere
1328. in the neighborhood, determined not to return home without the boy. And
1329. even if they were not found, how far was it to the north? How will we
1330. get there if Benjamin is already too tired to go further?
1331. 
1332. Toward midnight they suddenly saw a fire burning on a meadow. People
1333. must be there. The dog dragged the boy into some thick bushes, told him
1334. to keep still, crept softly toward the fire. A pot hung over the fire,
1335. and a blond man sat before it. Close by stood a wagon with large
1336. wheels, to which a brown horse was harnessed. The dog looked at the man
1337. very searchingly. He looked different from the people at home, had a
1338. very light skin, kind blue eyes; surely he was a northerner. But was he
1339. a good man? Then the dog remembered that only very good people
1340. understand the language of animals, and the dog decided to tell him the
1341. story of little Benjamin. Carefully he came closer to the fire and said
1342. softly, “Good evening, man. Are you a northerner?”
1343. 
1344. The man looked at him in surprise, but, oh joy, he had understood the
1345. words and answered, “Good evening, my friend. Yes, I am a northerner.
1346. Do you want to eat something? My supper will soon be ready.”
1347. 
1348. “I am not hungry,” replied the dog. “But I want some help.” And then he
1349. told the story of little Benjamin.
1350. 
1351. The blond man became red with anger and his eyes sparkled. This made
1352. the dog happy. “He is really a good man,” thought he, “for only good
1353. people are angered by the sufferings of other people.” When he was
1354. through speaking, the man said, “Bring your little friend here quickly.
1355. My horse has rested enough. We will ride off immediately so that no one
1356. can capture Benjamin.”
1357. 
1358. How happy the little grey dog was! In spite of his weariness, he danced
1359. with joy, wagging his tail, and started toward the bushes where
1360. Benjamin was hidden. Then he saw something dreadful. A man came over
1361. the meadow with a dog, which ran straight towards the bushes. The grey
1362. dog howled with fright. The blond man looked up, jumped forward and
1363. called to the dog, “Keep the man back just a moment, and all will yet
1364. be well.” At that the dog ran toward the man. The man had reached the
1365. bush, with one bound the dog leaped at his throat, bit it hard, did not
1366. loosen his hold in spite of cuts and blows.
1367. 
1368. In the meantime the northerner had taken little Benjamin in his arms,
1369. ran hastily toward the wagon, jumped in, and called to the dog, “Follow
1370. us, we will wait for you in a safe place.” Then he cracked his whip,
1371. started on the road, the brown horse galloped ahead for it knew
1372. everything that was going on.
1373. 
1374. The grey dog still gripped the man’s throat, thinking every moment that
1375. if he could detain the man, it would be an advantage to the good man
1376. and little boy, and would save his friend. But the man, tired of
1377. wrestling, took a large knife from his pocket and plunged it deep into
1378. the breast of the faithful dog. The dog whimpered piteously and fell
1379. heavily to the ground. His clouded eyes still saw, far off in the
1380. distance, a tiny spot that kept growing smaller and smaller; that was
1381. the wagon which was carrying little Benjamin to freedom.
1382. 
1383. Great joy filled the dog’s heart. He wagged his bushy tail once more.
1384. Then he died.
1385. 
1386. The blond man and little Benjamin waited a long time in vain for the
1387. grey dog. Benjamin wept bitterly, and his new friend comforted him:
1388. “The brave dog will come running back. All is well with him.”
1389. 
1390. But though Benjamin was safe, he was always sad when he thought of his
1391. friend. But he did not know that the little grey dog had died for him,
1392. paying his debt of gratitude to Benjamin with his life.
1393. 
1394. 
1395. 
1396. 
1397. 
1398. 
1399. 
1400. 
1401. WHY?
1402. 
1403. 
1404. Once upon a time there was a little boy, who had neither father nor
1405. mother, who lived in the poorhouse in a little village. He was the only
1406. child in the whole house; all the others were broken-down old people
1407. who were always gloomy and cranky, who liked best to sit quietly in the
1408. sun, and who would become angry whenever the little boy, while at play,
1409. would bump against them or make too much noise.
1410. 
1411. A sad life it was for little Paul. He never heard a kind word, no one
1412. loved him, and no one petted or comforted him whenever he was unhappy.
1413. Instead of that he was scolded every day and often he was even spanked.
1414. One peculiarity of his particularly irritated the supervisors of the
1415. poorhouse: at every occasion he used to ask, “Why?” always wanting to
1416. know the cause for everything.
1417. 
1418. “You mustn’t always ask why,” angrily declared the stout Matron who was
1419. in charge of the poorhouse. “Everything is as it is, and therefore it
1420. is right.”
1421. 
1422. “But why have I no parents like the other children of the village
1423. have?” insisted little Paul.
1424. 
1425. “Because they are dead.”
1426. 
1427. “Why did they die?”
1428. 
1429. “Because the good Lord willed it so.”
1430. 
1431. “Why did the Lord will it so?”
1432. 
1433. “Keep quiet, you good-for-nothing! Leave me alone with your eternal
1434. questions.” The fat woman was quite red with anger, because she knew no
1435. answer to Paul’s questions, and nothing angers ignorant persons more
1436. than to be forced to say, “I don’t know.”
1437. 
1438. But no one was able to keep little Paul quiet. He looked right up into
1439. the angry red face and asked further, “Why are you so impatient with
1440. me?”
1441. 
1442. Slap! and he got a box on the ears. He began to cry, ran away, and
1443. while running asked, “Why do you hit me?”
1444. 
1445. He came to the chicken yard. There stood a big hen with many-colored
1446. feathers, cackling aloud, proudly strutting. “I have laid an egg! I
1447. have laid an egg!” And from all sides of the yard there sounded in
1448. chorus: “I have laid an egg! I have laid an egg!” The rooster, however,
1449. was angry because the hens were so proud of having done something which
1450. he could not do, and cried scornfully, “I am the rooster, you are only
1451. hens!” Along came Mary, the little blond servant of the poorhouse,
1452. gathered the eggs carefully into her blue apron, and carried them into
1453. the house.
1454. 
1455. “Where do all your eggs go to?” Paul asked the speckled Hen.
1456. 
1457. “To the city,” she cackled.
1458. 
1459. “Who eats them there?”
1460. 
1461. “The rich people, the rich people.” Thus spoke the hen proudly, as
1462. though it were a special honor for her.
1463. 
1464. “Why don’t I ever have an egg?” complained Paul. “I am always so
1465. hungry, you know.”
1466. 
1467. “Because you are a poor Have-nothing.” And the hen spread her plumage
1468. with dignity, and cocked her eye defiantly at Paul over her crooked
1469. beak.
1470. 
1471. “But why am I a poor Have-nothing?”
1472. 
1473. Now the hen became angry as had the stout Matron, and raged: “Get off
1474. with you! You make me tired with your questions.”
1475. 
1476. Disappointed, Paul slipped quietly away. The garden door stood open,
1477. and he stepped out onto the road, strolling along aimlessly until he
1478. came to the entrance of a cowshed. The shed belonged to a rich farmer.
1479. 
1480. Many sleek cows, white and reddish brown, stood in a row and gazed
1481. before them with large, soft eyes. Paul, feeling very hungry, stepped
1482. up to the most friendly looking cow, and begged, “Dear Cow, will you
1483. give me some of your milk to drink?”
1484. 
1485. “I dare not do that,” replied the Cow. “The milk belongs to the
1486. farmer.”
1487. 
1488. The little boy looked with astonishment at the Cow, then over the
1489. entire shed, slowly counting the animals: “One, two, three.” Upon
1490. reaching twelve he stopped, for although there were many more cows, he
1491. stopped because the counting was too hard for him. In the poorhouse he
1492. was taught to be gentle and obedient, but nothing else. “Twelve cows,”
1493. he said thoughtfully. “Is it possible that the farmer can drink the
1494. milk of twelve cows?”
1495. 
1496. “Oh no,” the friendly Cow informed him. “He sells the milk in the
1497. city.”
1498. 
1499. Paul remembered the words of the speckled hen, and he asked, “Do the
1500. poor children there get any of the milk?”
1501. 
1502. “Good gracious, Paul,” sighed the Cow, “how stupid and inexperienced
1503. you still are! From the milk they make delicious whipped cream, which
1504. then goes on cakes and puddings, and these are bought by rich people.”
1505. 
1506. “Why not by the poor—don’t they like to eat good cakes?”
1507. 
1508. “You shouldn’t ask me so many questions, little boy,” replied the Cow.
1509. “I am only a dumb Cow, and do not know what to answer you. Besides, you
1510. had better go away. This is the time when the farmer comes to the barn,
1511. and should he see you it might mean a good beating for you.”
1512. 
1513. Paul stroked the shining hide of the friendly Cow, and pursued his way.
1514. On and on he went, until he reached a great big wheat field through
1515. which the wind was blowing. It looked like softly moving golden waves.
1516. The ears sang with soft voices, sounding very sad, and Paul
1517. distinguished the words: “Soon the reapers will be here with their
1518. scythes, z-z, and will cut us down, z-z-z. Then the people will bake us
1519. into fine white bread, z-z-z.”
1520. 
1521. “Who eats the white bread?” asked Paul, who had never in his life
1522. tasted a piece of white bread.
1523. 
1524. “The rich people, the rich people,” sang the ears of wheat, swaying to
1525. the rhythm of the wind.
1526. 
1527. “Ah, again the rich people!” exclaimed Paul. “Does everything in this
1528. world belong to the rich people?”
1529. 
1530. “Everything, everything,” buzzed the ears.
1531. 
1532. “Why?”
1533. 
1534. This question seemed to amuse the ears very much and almost doubling
1535. with laughter, they sang, “How silly, how stupid you are!” However,
1536. they failed to answer Paul’s question. Paul was near to tears; he
1537. stamped angrily on the ground with his foot, and cried loudly, “I
1538. demand an answer to my questions. Is there no one to give me an
1539. answer?”
1540. 
1541. Just then a Porcupine crept slowly across the road and said, “The
1542. wisest creature I know of is the Owl who lives in the great oak forest.
1543. Why don’t you go to her, you question mark.”
1544. 
1545. “Can’t you tell me why...?”
1546. 
1547. The Porcupine did not permit Paul to finish; impatiently he drew in his
1548. head, shot out his quills, until he looked like a ball covered with
1549. spikes.
1550. 
1551. “I do not associate with people,” he said, and his voice became as
1552. sharp as his quills. “They are too stupid for me. Go to the Owl, but be
1553. sure not to irritate her or she will gouge her eyes at you.”
1554. 
1555. Night fell, sending out its black shadows, and covered all the land. It
1556. was dark in the forest and Paul became somewhat uneasy, yet this
1557. mysterious forest seemed more pleasant to him than the terrible
1558. poorhouse, and he walked on further.
1559. 
1560. The further he went the thicker and closer were the trees. Soon there
1561. was no longer a path; but Paul pushed on over the soft carpet of green
1562. moss. The fragrance of the forest was pleasant. Beneath the tall trees
1563. grew delicious strawberries and the little boy picked them and
1564. refreshed himself as he went along.
1565. 
1566. At last he came to a great oak, and saw the owl perched on one of the
1567. branches. The Owl wore a large pair of spectacles and studied
1568. attentively a green sheet which she held in her claws.
1569. 
1570. Paul halted beneath the tree and shouted, “Mrs. Owl! Mrs. Owl!”
1571. 
1572. But the Owl was so deeply absorbed in her studies, that she did not
1573. hear, and only after he had repeated his call several times did she
1574. look down. Uttering an angry cry, she glared down at Paul with fierce
1575. round eyes.
1576. 
1577. “Well, what is it you want?” she asked. “How dare you disturb me in my
1578. studies?”
1579. 
1580. “Excuse me, Mrs. Owl,” begged Paul. “The Porcupine sent me to you. He
1581. told me that you are the wisest creature he knows of. Surely, you will
1582. be able to answer my questions.”
1583. 
1584. “What matter the opinions of the Porcupine to me? What have I to do
1585. with your questions?” growled the Owl. “Why should I waste my precious
1586. time on such a stupid child as you? You know very well that I can see
1587. only at night and the summer nights are so short that I have hardly
1588. time enough for my studies. I, too, think over all kinds of questions.
1589. One in particular has bothered me for countless years; I have grown old
1590. and grey over it, and yet no science in the world has helped me to
1591. solve it.” The Owl sighed deeply and her countenance became sorrowful.
1592. 
1593. “And just what is this question of yours?” Paul inquired anxiously.
1594. 
1595. “Do you think, perhaps, that YOU can answer it, you young saucebox?”
1596. sneered the Owl. “Around this question hang all the other questions of
1597. the world; it is: Why are all people so stupid?”
1598. 
1599. “Are all people really so stupid?” asked Paul, astonished.
1600. 
1601. “Yes, and if you don’t know that, why do you disturb me? Is it because
1602. you have never seen anything that you are so idiotic?”
1603. 
1604. “Very little,” replied the little boy shamefacedly. “You ought to know,
1605. dear Mrs. Owl, that I live in a poorhouse, where there are only old
1606. folks, and naturally they are all wise.”
1607. 
1608. “Ha, ha, ha,” laughed the owl. It sounded most awful in the dark
1609. forest. “Ha, ha, ha! You are certainly another splendid example of the
1610. stupidity of mankind. So it is in the poorhouse that all people are
1611. wise? Well, we will see if you are right. Who is it that you like best
1612. in the poorhouse?”
1613. 
1614. “Mary.”
1615. 
1616. “Who is Mary?”
1617. 
1618. “The maid.”
1619. 
1620. “What does she do?”
1621. 
1622. “She works all day long. She gets up at five o’clock in the morning,
1623. and is the last one to go to bed.”
1624. 
1625. “Then she most likely earns lots of money, wears beautiful clothes, and
1626. eats good food?”
1627. 
1628. “Oh no, she’s as poor as a beggar, she patches her clothes over and
1629. over, and eats what other people leave.”
1630. 
1631. “H-m-m. Well, why then does she work so hard if she gets nothing out of
1632. it?”
1633. 
1634. Little Paul thought a while, finally he said, “I don’t know.”
1635. 
1636. “But I know—it is because she is stupid. Mary knows, too, that there
1637. are fashionable ladies who don’t move a hand, who wear gorgeous
1638. clothes, eat costly food, live in luxury. Hasn’t Mary ever asked
1639. herself: How is it that I, who work all day long have nothing, and
1640. they, who do nothing have everything?”
1641. 
1642. “I believe not.”
1643. 
1644. “Well then, your Mary is stupid, very stupid. Whom do you still
1645. consider wise, you little sheep?”
1646. 
1647. “Old Jacob.”
1648. 
1649. “Who is this Old Jacob?”
1650. 
1651. “He is an old laborer, he is eighty years old. He worked until his
1652. seventieth year. Now he can’t do anything more, and has his hands and
1653. feet and legs crippled by rheumatism.”
1654. 
1655. “He worked sixty years for others! A pretty long time. I suppose that
1656. Old Jacob is treated like a prince, everybody is terribly anxious to
1657. serve him? He has a wonderful soft bed for his tired limbs, gets
1658. special kind of food every day, lives well and happily?”
1659. 
1660. “Oh no, the old matron always curses at him when he complains that the
1661. bread is too hard for his old teeth. And if he asks for a little
1662. tobacco, she gets angry and cries that he is unreasonable.”
1663. 
1664. “Why then did Old Jacob work until he was seventy years old, if now
1665. when he’s old he doesn’t even live well?”
1666. 
1667. “I don’t know.”
1668. 
1669. “Because he is stupid. He knows also, just like Mary, that there are
1670. fine young gentlemen who do nothing at all and yet live like kings. Do
1671. you see now, little imp, that people are stupid?”
1672. 
1673. “Yes,” said Paul sadly. “But I would like to ask you something, dear
1674. Mrs. Owl. Why are there rich people in the world?”
1675. 
1676. “You really ought to be able to answer this question yourself after our
1677. talk, little stupid head: Because the poor people are stupid.”
1678. 
1679. “But why are they stupid?”
1680. 
1681. But now the owl became angry, the same as the fat matron and the
1682. brightly speckled hen.
1683. 
1684. “Didn’t I tell you, little imp, you stupid little person, that I have
1685. been thinking about this question for years and years? Come back again
1686. eighty years from now, perhaps I will answer you then.”
1687. 
1688. “But why...?”
1689. 
1690. “Quiet!” the owl commanded little Paul. “You have stolen enough
1691. valuable time from me already. Go to the Cuckoo!”
1692. 
1693. “Where does she live?” asked the frightened little boy.
1694. 
1695. But already the Owl had adjusted her spectacles, become absorbed in the
1696. green leaf, and gave no answer.
1697. 
1698. “Oh, poor me!” little Paul thought sadly. “Now I am to go to the
1699. Cuckoo, and I don’t even know where she lives. Will the Cuckoo know
1700. more than the Owl? And I am already so tired, my feet hurt me.”
1701. 
1702. He sank down upon the soft green moss at the foot of a slender young
1703. birch. Little by little he became very depressed. He was thinking how
1704. he was altogether abandoned and alone, how nobody was good to him, and
1705. all at once he began to weep bitterly. Thereupon he became aware of a
1706. thin small voice coming from somewhere high up; it sounded like little
1707. bells of pure silver.
1708. 
1709. “Why are you crying, little child?” the silvery voice asked.
1710. 
1711. Paul looked upward and he saw the most wonderful little creature he had
1712. ever beheld in his life. Upon a branch of the birch sat a fairy. She
1713. had long golden-blond hair, which reached down to her feet, her little
1714. face was pale and delicate as moonlight, and her big eyes shone green
1715. like the leaves of the birch. She fluttered down toward Paul very
1716. lightly, alighted on his shoulder, it was as though a light leaf
1717. touched him, and stroked his face with her tiny white hands. Paul’s
1718. heart warmed. How good it was to be touched by tender hands! His tears
1719. stopped, he stared at the little creature, and asked at last, “Who are
1720. you?”
1721. 
1722. “I am a Dryad, I am the soul of the birchtree,” declared the little
1723. creature. “All day long I must sit in my tree, but when night comes I
1724. am free, I walk about on the earth, play with the other Dryads, my
1725. sisters. But tell me, for what reason are you sad?”
1726. 
1727. Paul told the Dryad of his unhappiness, saying at the end, “I must
1728. always ask why. The question burns in my heart, hurts me, and I believe
1729. if I ever receive an answer I will be happy. But now this question
1730. stands between me and all other people who do not ask the question like
1731. a big wall and this makes me so lonesome.”
1732. 
1733. The little Dryad laughed and her pretty face became sweeter and more
1734. tender than before.
1735. 
1736. “You are mistaken, little Paul,” she said softly. “You are not alone.
1737. Hundreds and thousands ask the same question, sad and troubled. Put
1738. your ear down to the earth and tell me what you hear.”
1739. 
1740. Paul obeyed. At first he heard only an indistinct sighing and
1741. whispering, then he thought he heard a terrible weeping and crying, and
1742. at last he heard words.
1743. 
1744. “Mother, I am hungry, why is there nothing to eat?” cried a child’s
1745. voice.
1746. 
1747. “I am stifling in this hot city, why can’t I go to the country like my
1748. rich schoolmates?” murmured a boy’s voice.
1749. 
1750. “I work all day, why are wages so low that I scarcely have enough to
1751. live on?” sobbed a woman’s voice.
1752. 
1753. “Why have the idlers everything and the workers nothing?” said a man’s
1754. voice threateningly.
1755. 
1756. And then all the voices rang together, crying, murmuring, sobbing,
1757. threatening, “Why? Why?”
1758. 
1759. Paul sat up, looked at the little Dryad who sat very quietly near him
1760. and asked, “Who are these people whom I heard?”
1761. 
1762. “They are your people,” replied the little Dryad. “That is your family.
1763. You have heard all the languages in the world, you will hear questions
1764. from all mouths, angrily, anxiously, threateningly. Every day new
1765. voices join the chorus, and when the thousands of voices become
1766. millions and billions, then there will be an end to the misery and
1767. poverty and to those lazy parasites.”
1768. 
1769. “When will that be?” asked Paul eagerly.
1770. 
1771. “That I cannot tell you, I know only this—every time I put my ear to
1772. the earth, I find new voices added and that is how I know that the day
1773. is not far distant.”
1774. 
1775. “And can nothing be done to make the day come sooner?”
1776. 
1777. “Of course. There are many, many people who do not know yet how good it
1778. is for other people and how bad their lives are; who work like beasts
1779. and never ask why their honest labor brings a starvation wage. These
1780. poor blind people must be shown the truth, and this is not at all easy,
1781. because the poor are so tired from the day’s work that they can hardly
1782. think; and the rich do everything not to awaken questions in the minds
1783. of the workers. That is why they punish every one who asks, ‘Why?’ You
1784. have already learned from your own experience, little Paul.”
1785. 
1786. “Then I must continue asking questions?”
1787. 
1788. “Yes, little Paul, but do not ask the rich, they will not answer you
1789. because if they did they would have to say, ‘The world is such a bad
1790. place for poor people because we, the rich, are greedy, selfish, vile,’
1791. and no person likes to say that about himself. But go to the poor
1792. people, ask them, ‘Why do you eat dry bread though you work hard, while
1793. the idle rich eat cake? Why are your children pale, thin and ill while
1794. the rich children are rosy, fat and healthy? Why does your long life of
1795. toil end in the poorhouse, whereas the lazy grafters are well taken
1796. care of in their old age, resting luxuriously from their lives of
1797. idleness?’ Ask the poor people these questions so long and so often
1798. that they will fall on the structure of injustice like a hammer and
1799. smash it. Will you do it, little Paul?”
1800. 
1801. “Yes,” replied the boy with eyes alight.
1802. 
1803. The little Dryad kissed his forehead and said earnestly, “Your life
1804. will be hard, little Paul. The rich, who are afraid of losing what they
1805. have robbed, will punish you. They will try to choke the question in
1806. your throat, they will throw you into jail, that no one may hear your
1807. voice. But you must not lose courage, for the question was not born in
1808. you in vain, you are destined to speak before many thousands who are
1809. today still dumb. And you will find comrades, friends—you will not be
1810. alone.”
1811. 
1812. The little Dryad nodded laughingly to Paul, swept lightly upwards, and
1813. sat on a branch of the birch.
1814. 
1815. “Are you going already,” asked little Paul, worried.
1816. 
1817. “You must go home, little Paul. But you must always come back and I
1818. will comfort you and help you.”
1819. 
1820. “Wait a little,” begged Paul. “The Owl said in eighty years, not until
1821. eighty years from now, she will be able to answer my question. That is
1822. a long time. Did the Owl speak truly?”
1823. 
1824. “That depends on you people,” replied the light, silvery voice of the
1825. tiny Dryad. “Perhaps it will take you eighty years to become wise,
1826. perhaps if you, you and your comrades, do not stop asking questions, it
1827. may only take fifty years. The great day of freedom may come in twenty,
1828. in ten years. Yes, perhaps even tomorrow.”
1829. 
1830. The tiny Dryad disappeared into the tree, but all the tree called in
1831. light, joyous voices to little Paul:
1832. 
1833. “Tomorrow! Tomorrow! Tomorrow!”

2094. 
2095. Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
2096. 
2097. Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
2098. electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
2099. computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
2100. exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
2101. from people in all walks of life.
2102. 
2103. Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
2104. assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
2105. goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
2106. remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
2107. Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
2108. and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
2109. generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
2110. Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
2111. Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
2112. www.gutenberg.org
2113. 
2114. Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
2115. Archive Foundation
2116. 
2117. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
2118. 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
2119. state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
2120. Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
2121. number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
2122. Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
2123. U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.
2124. 
2125. The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
2126. Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
2127. to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
2128. and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
2129. 
2130. Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
2131. Literary Archive Foundation
2132. 
2133. Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
2134. widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
2135. increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
2136. freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
2137. array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
2138. ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
2139. status with the IRS.
2140. 
2141. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
2142. charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
2143. States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
2144. considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
2145. with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
2146. where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
2147. DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
2148. state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
2149. 
2150. While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
2151. have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
2152. against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
2153. approach us with offers to donate.
2154. 
2155. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
2156. any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
2157. outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
2158. 
2159. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
2160. methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
2161. ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
2162. donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate
2163. 
2164. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
2165. 
2166. Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
2167. Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
2168. freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
2169. distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
2170. volunteer support.
2171. 
2172. Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
2173. editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
2174. the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
2175. necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
2176. edition.
2177. 
2178. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
2179. facility: www.gutenberg.org
2180. 
2181. This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
2182. including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
2183. Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
2184. subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
2185.
